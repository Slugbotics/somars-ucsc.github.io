  <!-- Why subteams exist -->
  <section id="why-subteams" class="section">
    <h2>Why Subteams?</h2>
    <p>
      Our vehicle is too complex for any one person to handle alone. Subteams
      let members specialize in specific parts of the system while still
      collaborating on a single ROV.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each subteam owns a core area—electronics, software, mechanisms,
      motion, or structure—so work can move in parallel. Members get deeper
      experience in the domain they care about, and the ROV gets the focused
      attention it needs to perform during competition.

    <h2>Q &amp; A</h2>
    <div class="qa-list">
      <div class="qa-item">
        <h3>Do I have to pick just one subteam?</h3>
        <p>
          Not necessarily. Many members start on one subteam and later branch
          into another. We encourage you to focus on one area at first so you
          can build depth, then explore others once you're comfortable.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="qa-item">
        <h3>Can I switch subteams later?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Talk with the subteam leads and we’ll help you transition so
          ongoing tasks aren’t disrupted. People switch when they discover new
          interests or want a different challenge.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="qa-item">
        <h3>How experienced do I need to be?</h3>
        <p>
          We don’t expect prior experience. We’ll teach you the tools we use and
          pair you with more experienced members. Curiosity and consistency are
          more important than what you already know.

    <h2>How Do I Join?</h2>
    <p>
      Joining the team is simple, and you can get involved at any point in the
      year. Here’s the usual flow:
    </p>

    <div class="qa-list">
      <div class="qa-item">
        <h3>1. Complete the Slugworks Canvas / join our Discord</h3>
        <p>
          We do all of our work in BE-49 in Slugworks. In order to gain access to our workspace, you'll have to complete
          the training canvas module as well as do a safety walkthrough. Additionally join our discord to keep up to date!
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="qa-item">
        <h3>2. Visit a few subteam meetings</h3>
        <p>
          Check out our subteam meeting times (All located within the website)! If they don't work with your schedule feel free to reach out to the leads. We reschedule
          our meeting times at the beginning of every quarter to fit to everyone's schedule. Feel free to job around subteams to see what fits your interest.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="qa-item">
        <h3>3. Commit to a subteam</h3>
        <p>
          Once you’ve tried things out, pick a primary subteam and start taking
          on slightly larger tasks—docs, wiring, modeling, code, testing,
          whatever makes sense for that group.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="card-meta" style="margin-top:1rem;">
      If you’re ever unsure where to start, just ask any subteam lead or reach
      out via the contact info on the home page.
